Three levels have three stages for each.

OK, let's show you the detailed of the three games.

## Simple - Arithmetic Game

For simple level, it's an arithmetic game.

For this game, each stage will give you an arithmetic operation. 

To pass it, just enter the result of that arithmetic operation.

For some reasons, I'll just show you the first stage.

Just like the title, in this level, each stages will give you a picture and a question.

Answering the question based on the picture correctly and you'll pass.

Same, I'll just show you the first stage.
